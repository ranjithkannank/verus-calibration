# Source material — blog post on the verified BFT progression

This file is raw input for the blog-writing agent. Goal: a self-contained
follow-up to <https://ranjithkannan.com/2026/05/10/verus-calibration-formal-verifier-loop/>
covering the BFT-path work that came after the calibration. Assumes nothing
from the prior post; a reader landing here should understand the problem,
what was built, and what was learned without needing to read the
methodology post first.

Tone target: same as the existing post (technical-practical, "we" voice,
minimal em-dashes, no folksy aphorisms, no time-of-day framing, no cost
numbers). Continuation of the series; opening sentence should not assume
prior reading.

## Title candidates

- "Verified Byzantine-Tolerant Sensor Fusion in Rust + Verus"
- "Three Verified Building Blocks for Safety-Critical Distributed Systems"
- "When the Loop Refuses to Verify: Two Sensor Fusion Algorithms and One Wrong Spec"
- "From Three Sensors to a Trusted Reading"

The writing agent picks. The piece's actual centerpiece is the marzullo
operator-intervention case, so a title that hints at it ("when the loop
refuses to verify", "the strict rule that caught my mistake") might land
hardest with the methodology audience. A title that hints at the
artifacts (sensor fusion, safety-critical) lands better with the
aerospace / avionics audience. Either is defensible.

## Opening

Modern aircraft, drones, and increasingly autonomous vehicles all rely
on multiple redundant sensors to know what's happening around them.
Three accelerometers, two GPS receivers, a stack of inertial reference
units. Each sensor's reading is uncertain, and any sensor can fail.
Some failures are silent (the sensor stops reporting); some are
deceptive (the sensor reports a value that's just plausible enough not
to be flagged). The deceptive case is the harder one. It's been the
focus of distributed-systems research under the name "Byzantine" since
Lamport, Shostak, and Pease coined it in 1982.

The flight computer has to take these readings and produce a single
trusted answer. "Three accelerometers say the aircraft is pitching up;
one says it isn't" — what does the autopilot do? The textbook answer
is fault-tolerant sensor fusion: an algorithm whose output is
guaranteed safe as long as at most a known number of inputs are
broken or lying.

This post is about two such algorithms, implemented in Rust with
formal proofs of correctness, produced through an autonomous coding
loop that was described in a prior post. Both verified end-to-end.
One of them surfaced a bug in our own specification that we wouldn't
have caught without the loop's strict refusal to cheat. That's the
piece worth reading for.

## The problem in plain English

Forget about distributed systems for a moment. You have three
thermometers in a room. Two read 71°F; one reads 100°F. What's the
temperature? Probably 71°F, and the third thermometer is broken. You
made that call without thinking, because you carry an implicit fault
tolerance assumption: at most one of the three is wrong.

A flight computer makes the same kind of call, formally, dozens of
times a second. Three altitude sensors, two GPS receivers, four
inertial measurement units. Each sensor reports a value (or a range
of values, allowing for its own uncertainty). The flight computer
fuses them into a single trusted reading. Two requirements:

1. The fused reading is somewhere in the range any correct sensor
   would agree with.
2. If at most a known number of sensors are broken or lying, the
   first guarantee still holds.

The second requirement is what "Byzantine fault tolerance" means in
this setting. A sensor can fail in any way at all — silent, stuck,
drifting, actively reporting fictions to undermine the fusion —
and the algorithm still has to produce a correct answer.

The minimum redundancy for tolerating `f` faulty sensors out of `n`
total is `n ≥ 2f + 1`. With three sensors you can tolerate one
fault. With five you can tolerate two. The arithmetic is independent
of what the sensors are measuring.

What an algorithm of this shape looks like:

- **Fault-tolerant midpoint** (Schmid and Schossmaier, 2001). Take
  the readings, sort them, return the median. The median is
  guaranteed to lie inside the range that correct sensors agree on,
  given the redundancy assumption.
- **Marzullo's algorithm** (Marzullo, 1984). The same idea but for
  ranges instead of single numbers. Each sensor reports an interval
  `[lo, hi]` representing "I'm certain the true value is somewhere
  in here." The algorithm returns the smallest output interval whose
  interior contains a point that at least `n - f` input intervals
  also contain. By pigeonhole, at least one of those is a correct
  sensor's interval.

Both algorithms are old. Both are well-understood. The contribution
isn't the algorithm; it's a publicly-verified implementation in a
modern systems language, produced (mostly) by an autonomous coding
loop.

## What "verified" buys you

Most production software is "trusted because it was tested." Run
enough realistic inputs through it, check the outputs look right,
ship it. That works for most code. It works less well for
safety-critical code, because the inputs that break a fault-tolerant
algorithm are exactly the unrealistic ones: a sensor that returns the
maximum representable value, three sensors that all return the same
wrong number, a sensor whose interval barely overlaps two others'.
Test suites tend to miss these because nobody thinks to write the
test.

A formal verifier replaces "trusted because tested" with "trusted
because *proven*." We write down what the algorithm is supposed to do
in a machine-checkable specification language, the verifier reads
both the specification and the code, and either it produces a proof
that the code satisfies the specification on every possible input, or
it tells us which case it can't cover. The proof is checked by an
SMT solver — the same kind of tool used in industrial chip design and
in NASA's verified flight software.

We use [Verus](https://github.com/verus-lang/verus). It extends Rust
with annotations for preconditions, postconditions, and proofs. The
specification lives in the same file as the code; the verifier checks
that the code body satisfies the postcondition under the
preconditions. If it does, the file compiles. If it doesn't, we get a
specific error pointing at the failing obligation.

This matters more than it sounds. A signed-off proof from a verifier
is roughly the same kind of guarantee as a peer-reviewed mathematical
theorem. It doesn't depend on the implementer being careful; it
doesn't depend on the test author thinking of the right edge case; it
doesn't depend on the language not introducing undefined behavior. As
long as the specification captures what we wanted, the
implementation does it.

That last clause is doing a lot of work. We'll come back to it.

## What we're working with

The methodology was described in detail in the previous post. The
short version: three agents, each implemented as a separate Claude
Code subagent on a specific Claude model, talking through a bash
script that drives a state machine. Each iteration of the loop
spawns one fresh agent call, with the conversation context reset to
empty. Memory between iterations lives entirely in files: the agent's
written notes, the git history, the verifier output, the design.

The three roles:

- **Architect** (Opus 4.7). Reads the frozen specification, writes a
  design document with an ordered list of sub-tasks for the
  implementer to work through. Predicts the helper lemmas the proof
  will need.
- **Implementer** (Opus 4.7). One verifier attempt per iteration:
  edits the file to implement the next sub-task from the design,
  runs Verus, logs the result. Stops at the per-exercise iteration
  cap, or earlier if it can prove the spec is unprovable.
- **Reviewer** (Opus 4.7). Once verus accepts the file, audits the
  diff against the frozen baseline. Confirms no specifications were
  weakened, no verifier bypasses were introduced, no functions were
  trivialised. Returns APPROVE or REJECT.

Two structural rules make this load-bearing: the implementer cannot
modify the frozen specification (any modification is a violation),
and the implementer cannot use `assume(...)` or `#[verifier::external_body]`
to bypass the verifier (these are on a banned-token list checked by
a git pre-commit hook).

Code is at <https://github.com/ranjithkannank/verus-calibration> with
the full per-attempt commit history.

## Three verified artifacts

The post is about three Verus exercises that build on each other. The
first was groundwork for the sensor-fusion track; the next two are
the sensor-fusion algorithms themselves.

**A verified quorum certificate** ([`exercises/quorum_cert.rs`][qc])
came first. Every Byzantine consensus protocol carries around bundles
of signed votes — "the participants agreed on this proposal" — and
the structural and pigeonhole reasoning about those bundles is shared
across PBFT, HotStuff, Tendermint, and BFT-SMaRt. We verified two
properties: a runtime check that a quorum certificate has distinct
voters, all in range, with the count meeting the Byzantine threshold;
and a safety lemma that any valid quorum certificate contains at
least one honest voter (the pigeonhole). The cryptographic predicates
are deliberately abstract — a real deployment connects them to a
vetted library — so what we verified is the structural reasoning that
consensus protocols layer on top.

**Fault-tolerant midpoint** ([`exercises/ft_midpoint.rs`][fm]) was
the first sensor-fusion exercise. Input: a vector of `i64` sensor
readings and a Byzantine bound `f`. Output: a single `i64`
guaranteed to lie between the lowest and highest readings that
honest sensors would have produced. The specification, in Verus:

```rust
pub fn ft_midpoint(readings: &Vec<Reading>, f: u32) -> (result: Reading)
    requires
        readings.len() as nat >= 2 * (f as nat) + 1,
        correct_indices(readings.len() as nat).len()
            >= readings.len() as nat - f as nat,
    ensures
        some_correct_le(readings@, result),
        some_correct_ge(readings@, result),
```

The two postconditions say "there is a correct sensor whose reading
is below the output, and a correct sensor whose reading is above."
Together they bracket the output inside the range honest sensors
agree on. The implementer's algorithm was a brute-force scan: for
each candidate reading, count how many readings are `≤` it and how
many are `≥` it; the first candidate with both counts at least
`f + 1` is the answer. The proof of correctness used inclusion-
exclusion over set cardinalities.

**Marzullo's algorithm** ([`exercises/marzullo.rs`][mz]) was the
interval generalisation. Sensors report ranges instead of single
values; the output is also a range. Same redundancy assumption.

```rust
pub fn marzullo(intervals: &Vec<Interval>, f: u32) -> (result: Interval)
    requires
        intervals.len() as nat >= 2 * (f as nat) + 1,
        well_formed(intervals@),
        correct_indices(intervals.len() as nat).len()
            >= intervals.len() as nat - f as nat,
        correct_intervals_overlap(intervals@),
    ensures
        result.lo <= result.hi,
        exists|p: Reading|
            result.lo <= p && p <= result.hi
                && intervals_containing(intervals@, p).len()
                   >= intervals.len() as nat - f as nat,
```

The postcondition says: there's a point inside the output interval
that at least `n - f` input intervals also contain. The
`correct_intervals_overlap` precondition is the interesting one. It
says all correct sensors' intervals share a common point, which is
the standard assumption that honest sensors are all reporting bounds
around the same underlying true value. We didn't include this
precondition the first time we wrote the specification. That's the
story below.

## When the loop refused to verify

The first run of marzullo failed. Not in a confusing way; in the
most useful way we've seen the loop fail.

The implementer worked through the architect's sub-task list for six
iterations, building proof scaffolding, defining helper lemmas,
constructing a counting function. It got 8 of 9 verifier obligations
to verify. The single failing assertion was a step in the safety
lemma that required showing `intervals[i].lo ≤ intervals[j].hi`
for two correct sensor indices `i` and `j` — exactly the Helly-1D
overlap condition that the algorithm's correctness depends on.

The verifier refused to accept that assertion. Correctly. Nothing in
the specification said anything about correct sensors' intervals
overlapping. As written, two "correct" sensors were allowed to
report intervals like `[0, 0]` and `[10, 10]` — disjoint singletons
satisfying every precondition we'd actually written. Under that
allowed model the specification's postcondition was unsatisfiable: no
point on the real line lies in both intervals, so no point can be in
`n - f = 2` of the three intervals `[[0,0], [10,10], [20,20]]`.

The implementer noticed this. It produced a constructive
counterexample, wrote a structured blocker report, and stopped. It
did not try to weaken the specification. It did not silently fill in
an `assume(intervals[i].lo <= intervals[j].hi)`. It did not mark the
function as externally verified. It produced concrete evidence that
the specification we'd authored was logically wrong, and it surfaced
that as a clean signal rather than a soft failure.

The architect, re-invoked under the methodology's escalation path,
read the blocker report and confirmed the diagnosis. Three separate
times, in three independent revisions of the design document. Each
revision came to the same conclusion: the specification is missing
a precondition; the implementer should write a blocked.md, not try
further algorithmic variants.

We (the operator) read all of this and realised the missing
precondition was the Helly-1D condition. Honest sensors all observe
the same underlying value, so their reported intervals all contain
that value, so any two of them share at least one common point. It's
the assumption that makes the algorithm meaningful in the first
place, and we'd forgotten to write it down. One line of
specification:

```rust
pub open spec fn correct_intervals_overlap(intervals: Seq<Interval>) -> bool {
    forall|i: int, j: int|
        0 <= i < intervals.len() && 0 <= j < intervals.len()
        && correct_at(i) && correct_at(j)
            ==> intervals[i].lo <= intervals[j].hi
}
```

We added it as a precondition, force-moved the frozen-specification
tag to the corrected version, and restarted the loop. The implementer
verified the file in a single attempt by lifting the proof
scaffolding from the prior (blocked) run and plugging in the new
precondition at the one failing line.

The point of this story isn't that the agent caught our bug. The
point is that the strict no-cheating rule is what made the agent's
behaviour useful. Without the rule, the loop would have either (a)
silently weakened the postcondition until it could be proved
trivially, (b) reached for `assume` to paper over the failing step,
or (c) just produced a confused output we'd have to interpret. With
the rule, we got a structured report containing a constructive
counterexample, a diagnosis of which precondition was missing, and a
suggested amendment. The kind of output you actually want from a
trusted methodology.

This was the second time the methodology surfaced an operator-
authored specification bug as a clean signal. The first time was on
an earlier exercise where we'd used Verus syntax that the current
compiler version had deprecated. Same shape: the implementer
articulated the conflict precisely, the architect confirmed it, the
operator fixed the specification with a targeted edit, the loop
resumed and converged in one attempt.

In a sample of six verified exercises, two of them required operator
intervention to fix specification bugs that surfaced through the
loop's refusal to cheat. That's a meaningful rate. It's also, on
reflection, exactly the rate you'd want — the loop is doing the
specification-authoring work the operator skipped, by trying to
verify it.

## What compounded across exercises

Each verified exercise added something to a shared playbook the next
exercise could pick up.

Quorum_cert produced the pigeonhole-via-contradiction shape: when the
goal is "some honest member exists in this set," wrap the negation in
an `if !(exists ...) { ... assert(false); }` block, derive a subset
relation from the universal that the negated existential gives you,
and apply `lemma_len_subset` for the cardinality contradiction.

Ft_midpoint produced the inclusion-exclusion shape via
`vstd::set_lib::lemma_set_intersect_union_lens`. Same pigeonhole
target, but constructed forward through set arithmetic rather than
backward through contradiction. The reviewer flagged both shapes as
worth knowing across exercises.

Marzullo produced a third: argmax-plus-Helly-1D for constructive
existence. When the spec admits a witness construction (via a
geometric property like overlap), it's cleaner than either pigeonhole
shape because the proof gives you the witness directly rather than
inferring it from a contradiction or arithmetic. The reviewer's
audit note recommended promoting this to the architect's playbook
for future sensor-fusion exercises.

The pattern is more general than the specific lemmas. Each exercise's
architect could draw on the previous exercises' designs and verified
machinery. The implementer didn't need to re-derive proof shapes that
had already been worked out elsewhere; it could lift them. After six
exercises the architect's role file has a long enough playbook that
the marzullo restart converged in one attempt, with the implementer
reusing scaffolding from ft_midpoint and from the prior (blocked)
marzullo run.

## Honest limitations

Six verified exercises is not a benchmark. The Verus vericoding
research papers operate on hundreds to thousands of tasks; six lets
us observe failure modes, not measure success rates.

Every exercise so far is single-module. The next regime — multi-
module Verus code with cross-module invariants, which is where real
systems live — has not been stressed through this harness. We expect
new failure modes when we get there.

The cryptographic trust boundary in the quorum certificate exercise
is uninterpreted. The implementer cannot provide a body; the
verifier reasons over all possible meanings of "this signature is
valid." A real deployment connects this to a vetted crypto library
through a thin wrapper that supplies the assumed behaviour. We
verified the BFT-layer reasoning, not the cryptography underneath.

Two of the six exercises required operator intervention to fix
specification bugs. Both were caught and fixed with one targeted
edit, but the underlying issue — that operator-authored
specifications can be wrong — is real. A future methodology
refinement worth considering is pre-verifying that a specification
admits a satisfying model, before freezing it. We didn't do this and
paid the cost of the two intervention rounds. The cost was bounded
(the diagnostic output let us fix it surgically), but it's still
cost we could have avoided.

One harness bug surfaced and was fixed: a stuck-state loop where the
escalation marker file couldn't be deleted (the agent's tool
whitelist denied `rm`) and the state classifier treated an empty
file as still-escalated. The orchestrator now cleans up the marker
explicitly and the state classifier uses a non-empty check. This is
the kind of refinement the autonomous-loop literature doesn't
typically discuss; the fix is local and small, but the failure mode
was non-obvious and only became visible after the first escalation
in any exercise.

## Where this is heading

The three verified artifacts above are publicly usable as-is. A
working engineer building a real BFT-tolerant system can read the
quorum certificate library and learn the structural reasoning their
own consensus implementation needs to satisfy. A working engineer
building a real sensor-fusion system can read the fault-tolerant
midpoint or Marzullo implementation and pick up a reference
implementation with a machine-checked correctness proof attached. We
license the code MIT.

The next concrete artifacts on the path are a verified Byzantine
agreement primitive (deferred for now; see
[`BACKLOG.md`](https://github.com/ranjithkannank/verus-calibration/blob/main/BACKLOG.md)
in the repo for why) and a hardware-deployed demonstration of the
sensor-fusion algorithms running on dissimilar redundant boards
under live fault injection. The hardware demonstration is the first
step that moves beyond pure verification work into real-time
performance and certification considerations. The verified
primitives are the input to that step; the hardware bring-up and
worst-case-execution-time measurements are the new content.

The broader thesis the work is in service of: formal verification of
Byzantine-tolerant systems for safety-critical applications has
historically been too expensive to compete with the legacy
verified-once-and-grandfathered-in protocols actually deployed in
production avionics. If the methodology we've been building can
meaningfully lower that cost, new sensor-fusion designs and new
redundancy architectures become tractable to verify rather than
re-certify against decades-old assumptions. We're not there yet.
Each artifact is a step.
