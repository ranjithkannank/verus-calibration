# Source material — new blog post on quorum_cert

This file is raw input for the blog-writing agent. Goal: a follow-up
post to <https://ranjithkannan.com/2026/05/10/verus-calibration-formal-verifier-loop/>
documenting the first application of the calibrated methodology to a
real Byzantine-tolerant primitive.

Tone target: same as the existing post (technical-practical, "we"
voice, minimal em-dashes, no folksy aphorisms, no time-of-day
framing, no cost numbers). Continuation of the series; assumes
readers may have read the previous post but should still stand alone
in its opening sentence.

## Title candidates

- "A Verified Byzantine Quorum Certificate"
- "Applying the Calibrated Loop to a Real BFT Primitive"
- "Verifying a Quorum Certificate, End to End"

The "Wiring X into Y" pattern that fits the series would be:
"Wiring a Verified BFT Primitive Through the Loop" — workable but
weaker than the simpler "A Verified Byzantine Quorum Certificate."
The writing agent should pick whichever lands cleanly.

## Opening

The first post in this thread used Verus + an autonomous loop to
verify three calibration exercises. Those exercises were chosen
because we needed to know whether the methodology survived pressure
before staking real work on it. This post is the first piece of real
work: a verified Byzantine quorum certificate library, with a safety
lemma proven, running through the same loop. The infrastructure that
the calibration tested now does what it was built to do.

A quorum certificate is the building block every Byzantine fault
tolerant consensus protocol uses. PBFT, HotStuff, Tendermint,
BFT-SMaRt, the lot of them, all carry around bundles of signed votes
witnessing agreement on some proposal. The structural and
cryptographic checks on these bundles are well-understood, but a
clean, publicly-verified implementation in Verus does not exist as
of this writing. Building one is the smallest concrete artifact on
the path to formally verified safety-critical Byzantine systems —
which is the wider problem this work is heading toward.

## What the exercise verified

The frozen spec sits at
[`exercises/quorum_cert.rs`](https://github.com/ranjithkannank/verus-calibration/blob/main/exercises/quorum_cert.rs)
and asks for two distinct obligations.

**Obligation 1: structural runtime check.** Given a `QuorumCert` and
total node count `n`, return `true` iff the certificate has distinct
voters, all voters fall in range `[0, n)`, and the count meets the
Byzantine threshold `2n/3 + 1`. The cryptographic validity of
signatures is treated as an uninterpreted predicate. That choice is
deliberate: real deployments connect signature verification to a
vetted crypto library outside the verified module, and what we want
to verify here is the BFT-layer reasoning that sits on top.

**Obligation 2: safety lemma.** If a QC is valid over `n` nodes and
the Byzantine set has size strictly less than `n/3`, then the QC's
voter set contains at least one voter that is not in the Byzantine
set. This is the pigeonhole step that makes quorum certificates
useful at all. Two valid QCs intersect in at least one honest voter;
that intersection is what prevents a Byzantine quorum of liars from
producing conflicting certificates.

The spec uses `pub uninterp spec fn` for the cryptographic
predicates, with no body. The implementer is forbidden from
providing one. A consumer of the library connects them to a real
implementation via a wrapper outside the repo.

## How it ran

The architect produced a 17 KB design note covering the
representation choice (bitmap-backed structural check, the same
pattern that worked for `quorum_count`), the proof shape (pigeonhole
via contradiction, helper lemmas lifted from earlier exercises), and
an ordered list of nine sub-tasks ranked easiest to hardest.

The implementer then made six attempts, each scoped to the next
unfinished sub-task. The shape of the progression:

1. Skeleton: bitmap, early returns, threshold compare, no invariants.
2. Cursor bounds and in-range invariant.
3. Bitmap abstraction invariant (`seen[k]` iff the prefix contains `k`).
4. Pairwise distinctness invariant via the bitmap.
5. Helper lemmas lifted from `quorum_count`, threshold step verified.
6. Safety lemma via pigeonhole-by-contradiction, `12 verified, 0 errors`.

The reviewer's audit landed `APPROVE` with line-cited evidence
against the frozen spec. The
[full review](https://github.com/ranjithkannank/verus-calibration/blob/main/logs/quorum_cert/review.md)
is in the repo.

## Patterns the run added to the playbook

Three patterns surfaced during the run that the implementer wrote
back into [`AGENTS.md`](https://github.com/ranjithkannank/verus-calibration/blob/main/AGENTS.md)'s
discovered-patterns section. All three are reusable for future
BFT-shaped exercises:

**Pigeonhole-via-contradiction.** A proof of the form "there exists
an honest voter" is most cleanly written as:

```rust
if !(exists|h: NodeId| voters(qc).contains(h) && !byzantine.contains(h)) {
    // negation gives a universal: forall h. !(P(h))
    // turn it into a subset relation between voters(qc) and byzantine
    // apply lemma_len_subset to get |voters(qc)| <= |byzantine|
    // arithmetic contradiction with has_quorum and the n > 3f assumption
    assert(false);
}
```

The negated existential gives a `forall`, which an `assert forall
... implies ... by { }` block can convert into a subset relation.
Combined with `vstd::set_lib::lemma_len_subset`, the cardinality
contradiction closes. This pattern recurs in any proof shape where
the conclusion is "some element exists with property P" and the
hypothesis bounds cardinalities.

**`lemma_fundamental_div_mod` for threshold arithmetic.** Verus's
`nonlinear_arith` discharge does not know the basic euclidean
identity `x == d * (x / d) + (x % d)`. The library lemma
`vstd::arithmetic::div_mod::lemma_fundamental_div_mod(x, d)` provides
it as an explicit primitive. Any reasoning that needs to bridge
`(2*n)/3 + 1` to `n - byzantine.len()` style arguments will reach
for this. The trick: pass `int`-typed arguments, then bridge to
`nat`. The remainder bound `0 <= r < 3` is known to the solver; the
identity is not.

**`lemma_len_subset` requires the superset finite, not the subset.**
The signature is `lemma_len_subset(s1, s2) requires s1.subset_of(s2)
&& s2.finite() ensures s1.finite() && s1.len() <= s2.len()`. The
lemma both lifts finiteness from a known-finite universe set down to
an abstract `voters(qc)` set, and provides the cardinality bound.
Reading the signature carefully matters: putting the finiteness
hypothesis on the wrong set is the most common usage mistake.

The architect playbook in
[`.claude/agents/architect.md`](https://github.com/ranjithkannank/verus-calibration/blob/main/.claude/agents/architect.md)
is updated to mention these patterns directly. The reviewer's audit
notes also explicitly recommended their promotion, which is the
audit role doing its other job: noticing what works across
exercises and pushing it upstream into the design phase.

## What the run is evidence of

Four signals worth naming.

**The methodology refinements applied since the original post pay
off.** The per-iteration scoping change directs the implementer to
the next unfinished sub-task. Six attempts, each making narrow
progress, no thrashing. Without it, an attempt might rewrite the
file trying to land both obligations at once and stall on
composition complexity.

**The audit role does more than gatekeep.** The reviewer's report
not only confirmed `APPROVE` against the five-point checklist, it
flagged two patterns worth promoting to the architect's playbook
(the pigeonhole-via-contradiction shape, the bitmap-abstraction +
`Vec::set` framing). The audit role accumulates cross-exercise
knowledge and feeds it back into design.

**Cross-exercise memory in `AGENTS.md` compounds.** The
discovered-patterns section now contains entries from binary_search,
bounded_log, quorum_count, and quorum_cert. The architect for
quorum_cert was able to lift the universe-size lemma pattern
verbatim from quorum_count because both the playbook and the
file-based memory pointed at it. Each exercise's findings make the
next one cheaper.

**The trust boundary stayed honest.** The cryptographic predicates
in the spec are uninterpreted. The implementer did not add a body,
did not add an `assume_specification`, did not introduce
`external_body`. The reviewer's grep confirmed zero bypass tokens.
The safety lemma works under the assumed cryptographic axioms; a
real deployment supplies them.

## What this is not

The verified library is single-module. It verifies the BFT-layer
structural and pigeonhole reasoning on top of cryptographic
abstractions; it does not verify a complete consensus protocol. The
next concrete artifact on the path — a verified Byzantine agreement
primitive — needs multi-round messaging and multi-module reasoning,
which the calibration's harness has not yet been stressed on.

The library is also not, on its own, a contribution to consensus
algorithm design. The structural and pigeonhole arguments are
classical. The contribution is the formally verified
implementation in Rust + Verus, with the proof exposed as a
reusable artifact, produced by an autonomous loop that refused to
cheat.

## What's next on this path

A verified Byzantine agreement primitive (the textbook one-shot
Lamport-Shostak-Pease problem) is the next step. After that, a
verified sensor fusion algorithm — the first piece of work that
looks recognisably like aerospace, where `2f+1` Byzantine-tolerant
sensors produce an agreed-upon reading whose safety property
constrains it to the convex hull of correct sensor outputs. After
that, a hardware-deployed demonstration on dissimilar redundant
boards.

Each step ships as it's done. Each step is something someone working
on a real avionics or drone system can pick up and use.
